# Code Poster
Generate an SVG image from a source image using text taken from a github repository. This project is inspired by the Elixir project by Pete Corey. Pete did much of the hard logic, like determining the optimal image size and how to adjust the image to correct for the font width. Read his post (here|http://www.east5th.co/blog/2017/02/13/build-your-own-code-poster-with-elixir/) and see the elixir code (here|https://github.com/pcorey/elixir_poster)
